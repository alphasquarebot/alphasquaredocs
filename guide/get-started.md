# ðŸ’³ Get Started

**1. Choosing Your Blockchain**

Ready to dive into the crypto world? First things first: you need some of those native tokens to kick off your trading spree. Right now, we supports Ethereum, BSC Chain, and Base Chain.&#x20;

Wondering which one to pick? Check where your desired token hangs out: a little birdie (or maybe a community member) might tell you where you can snag the best deal. Just between us, Ethereum tends to be the posh choice (read: priciest), followed by BSC Chain, with Base Chain being the budget-friendly cousin.



**2. Purchasing Native Tokens**

Decided on your chain? Awesome! Now, it's shopping time.&#x20;

If you're on the Ethereum or Base Chain, grab some ETH. If BSC Chain's your jam, BNB token is the ticket.&#x20;

Already got some tokens in a centralized exchange? You're golden! Just withdraw some ETH or BNB to your sparkly new wallet address, and in a couple of minutes, you'll be trading with Alpha Square Bot.
