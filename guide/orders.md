**1. Order Status Explained:**

* ⌛️ **PENDING**: Your order is on standby. The blockchain hasn't packaged it yet.
* 🌐 **SENT**: Off it goes! Sent to the blockchain but not packaged yet.
* ✅ **FILLED**: Sweet success! 🎉 The order has been executed on the blockchain.
* ⛔️ **FAILED**: Oh snap! It was processed on the blockchain but didn't go through. No worries, we've got your back.
* ❌ **CANCELED**: Hit the brakes! This one's been stopped by you.

**2. Breaking Down Order Details:**

* **Pair**: This tells you the trade combo. For instance, if you swapped ETH for DAI, you'll see ETH ➡️ DAI.
* **Limit Price**: Setting a limit? This is the price you've set to trigger the trade. When the universe aligns and this price hits, we send your trade out to the blockchain galaxy. 🌌
* **Date**: This is when you made the magic happen! It's the date and time your trade was sent.

**3. Paging Through Your Orders:**

* See "All Orders 1/2"? That's page one! Hit ⏩ to flip to the next page and ⏭️ to jump to the last.

**4. Button Know-How:**

* **All**: Peep all your trades in one place. 🕵️
* **Pending**: See only those trades that are in the limbo, waiting for their time to shine.
* **Refresh**: Feeling things are a bit stale? Hit this to get the freshest info! 🔄

**5. The Deets on Transaction Hashes:** That funky string like "Order 0xc37...3e97"? That's the unique stamp for your trade on the blockchain. Think of it as the postal tracking number for your crypto package!
